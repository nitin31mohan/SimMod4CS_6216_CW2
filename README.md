#  Group Dynamics of Hard Workers and Lazy Workers

### Code for module Simulation Modelling for Computer Science (COMP6216) coursework_2 

The code can be run by executing 
        
        python main.py

(No special/additional libraries needed)

### The input parameters for the code can be customized by making changes to the `params.py` file which consists of all the parametric values used. Such as -- <br />

        def __init__(self) -> None:
                self.H = 1.0
                self.L = 0.0
                self.numGroups = 5
                self.groupSize = 3
                self.numCourses = 100
                self.initX = 0.5
                self.a = 0.5

The result can be viewed in a log file `log.txt` that is generated in the project's root directory
